A viewer can click and drag on the plot area to zoom in to a certain date range, and can double click anywhere to zoom back out. The drop down menu can be used to switch between different cities’ weather data. Finally, the top of the candle is the maximum temperature for that day, the bottom of the candle is the minimum temperature for that day, and the black line is the average temperature for that day. The candle is red if the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum temperature, and blue for the opposite.\nHere’s the link: Weather Data Candle Plot."
