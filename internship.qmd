## Irvine Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Undergraduate Data Science (ISI-BUDS)

### Summer Institutes in Biostatistics (SIBS) and Data Science - Internship

Jul 2024 - Aug 2024 \[6 weeks\]

Irvine, California, United States \[On-site\]

ISI-BUDS is a six-week paid internship supported by the National Institute Of Allergy And Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Summer Institutes in Biostatistics (SIBS).

The program introduces undergraduate students to modern methodology and the practice of biostatistics and data science, focused on advanced statistical methods, research, and presentation.

During the 2024 summer, I studied the impact of Alzheimer's Disease on two separate communities: the late-onset community (55+) and the Down syndrome community. Using linear regression and other modeling techniques, we analyzed the effect of neuropsychiatric symptoms on diagnosis and arrived at the conclusion that similar treatment methods could be applied to both groups.

Our final presentation is linked here: [Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Down Syndrome and Late-Life Alzheimerâ€™s Disease](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18tOIVX0PFC16COwNEK00_ZePgBFbssAGi3YmlpCKcTM/edit?usp=sharing).
