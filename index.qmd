My name is Noah McMahon, and I am currently a senior Statistics: Data Science major at the University of Washington. I am proficient in a variety of coding languages, ranging from R to Java to SQL, among others. I have excelled in my courses at the University of Washington, with a current GPA of 3.6. I am looking for a career in data analysis or statistics, and want to use my current skillset to better the world around me.
