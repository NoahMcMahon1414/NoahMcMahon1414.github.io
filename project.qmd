## Weather Data Candle Plot

This was my final project in my INFO 474 course *Interactive Information Visualization*. The goal of the project was to use weather data and create a completely different plot that answered a specific user question.

The user question that my candle plot answered was relating to a weather forecaster attempting to ascertain the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for a modifiable date range.

The visualization is coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A viewer can click and drag on the plot area to zoom in to a certain date range, and can double click anywhere to zoom back out. The drop down menu can be used to switch between different cities' weather data. Finally, the top of the candle is the maximum temperature for that day, the bottom of the candle is the minimum temperature for that day, and the black line is the average temperature for that day. The candle is red if the maximum temperature is greater than the minimum temperature, and blue for the opposite.

## Statistics Directed Reading Program 2023

This was the project that I completed during the Statistics Directed Reading Program in my 2023 spring quarter at the University of Washington. I learned about the topic of random walks from a graduate student and then presented what I learned to a group of fellow students from the directed reading program as well as statistics professors.

Below is my summary document of what I learned as well as the presentation that I presented to my fellow students and the statistics professors:
